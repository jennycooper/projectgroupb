			<p><i>When is the best time to come to Ireland?</i>
			<a href="#" id="q1-show" class="showLink"
				onclick="showHide('q1');return false;">Read</a></p>

				<div id="q1" class="more">

			<p class="answers">The summer months constitute the main tourist season in Ireland.
			July and August are particularly busy. This is also the time when the weather
			tends to be at its best. Hotels and accommodation in Ireland during this period
			can be expensive, although there are more affordable Irish hotels available
			for those willing to shop around. Cheap hotels are easier to find during
			the off-peak seasons, for instance in the autumn and spring.

			<p><i>Is tipping a custom in Ireland?</i>
			<a href="#" id="q2-show" class="showLink"
				onclick="showHide('q2');return false;">Read</a></p>

				<div id="q2" class="more">

			<p class="answers">Tipping is not ingrained in the Irish culture, and so is normally up to the
			discretion of the visitor. The minimum wage for workers in Ireland is quite high
			so tipping is not that customary. The most likely places that one may tip are
			in hairdressers, taxis, restaurants and in Irish hotels. 10-15% is sufficient,
			but in all cases, one should only tip if the service has been good!

			<p><i>Will I need a passport and/or visa to enter Ireland?</i>
			<a href="#" id="q3-show" class="showLink"
				onclick="showHide('q3');return false;">Read</a></p>


				<div id="q3" class="more">

			<p class="answers">A passport or national identity card is the only documentation needed by citizens of
			the other EU member states to enter Ireland. Citizens from non-EU states must have
			a passport but not a visa for a short-term trip to Ireland.
			Travellers from the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are
			not required to have a visa to enter the country. Citizens of a number of
			countries from the Middle East, Africa and Central and Eastern Europe are required
			to hold visas in order to enter Ireland. For further information, you should refer
			to the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin.

					<p class="answers">
						Most stores and shopping centres open from 9-6, Monday to Friday,
						with late night shopping on Thursday evenings, normally until 9pm.
						There is selective opening on Sundays, though Sunday trading is increasing
						in both popularity and availability. There are a number of local convenience stores
						that open from 8-11, some even later.<br/><br/>

						Banks open from 10-4 from Monday to Friday.<br/><br/>

						Bars and pubs have had their opening hours curtailed in the last years.
						Bars open from 10.30am to 11.30pm between Monday and Thursday.
						On Friday and Saturday evenings, last orders are at 12.30am. On Sundays,
						closing time is 11.30pm. The majority of nightclubs serve alcohol until 1.30am,
						and close at 2.30pm. There are some exceptions to this, mainly in Dublin city.

			<a href="#" id="q5-show" class="showLink"
				onclick="showHide('q5');return false;">Read</a></p>

				<div id="q5" class="more">

					<p class="answers">
					Pack sweaters, comfortable clothes, and perhaps a rain poncho and/or umbrella.
					The best way to stay warm is to dress in layers.  When the sun blasts through a
					grey sky, you want to peel off that sweater and soak up the sun wearing a t-shirt.
					If you’re hiking, pack shoes you’ve worn for a while.  This is no time for sore feet!
					If you’re going to a spa destination, casual but classy is always a safe bet.
					Be yourself and wear what makes you comfortable.  Ireland is a casual country.

				<div id="q6" class="more">

					<p class="answers">
					Ireland is most likely the safest country in Europe.  As in any large city,
					you should be aware of your surroundings in some parts of Dublin, especially at night.
					Violent crimes in Ireland against tourists are so rare as to be almost non-existent.

				onclick="showHide('q7');return false;">Read</a></p>

				<div id="q7" class="more">

					<p class="answers">
					Smoking is no longer permitted in public places.  This comes as a great relief to
					many visitors who are accustomed to this practice at home. It gives you many more options,
					particularly spending late nights at pubs.  And all are smoke-free!

				<p class="halfcoltext">Getting Around Ireland</p>
				<p>Travelling around Ireland is short, simple and sweet or maddeningly long and
				infuriatingly complicated. Distances are relatively short and there’s a good network of roads,
				but public transportation can be infrequent, expensive or both and especially with trains
				not reach many of the more interesting places. Below you will find a short info
				about transport in Ireland<br/><br/></p>
				<ul>
					<li id='li_tab1' onclick="selecttab('tab1')" class="active"><a>Bus</a></li>

						<b>Bus Éireann</b> (01-836 6111; <a href="http://www.buseireann.ie" onclick="OpenPopup(this.href); return false">
						www.buseireann.ie</a>; Busáras, Store St, Dublin) is the Republic’s
						bus line and offers an extensive network throughout the south. Private buses compete –
						often very favourably – with Bus Éireann in the Republic and also run where the national
						buses are irregular or absent.<br/>
						The larger bus companies will usually carry bikes for free but you should always check
						in advance to avoid surprises.<br/>
						<b>Ulster­bus</b> (028-9066 6600; <a href="http://www.ulsterbus.co.uk" onclick="OpenPopup(this.href); return false">
						www.ulsterbus.co.uk</a>; Milewater Rd, Belfast) is the only bus
						service in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>
						<b>Costs</b><br/>
						Bus travel is much cheaper than train travel,
						and private buses often charge less than Bus Éireann. Generally, return fares cost
						little more than a one-way fare.

						<b>Iarnród Éireann</b> (Irish Rail; 01-836 2222;
						<a href="http://www.irishrail.ie" onclick="OpenPopup(this.href); return false">
						www.irishrail.ie</a>; 35 Lower Abbey St, Dublin)
						operates trains in the Republic on routes that fan out from Dublin.
						The system is limited though: there’s no north-south route along the western coast,
						no network in Donegal, and no direct connections from Waterford to Cork or Killarney.<br/>
						<b>Northern Ireland Railways</b> (NIR; 028-9089 9411; Belfast Central Station)
						runs four routes from Belfast. One links with the system in the Republic via
						Newry to Dublin; the other three go east to Bangor, northeast to Larne and northwest
						to Derry via Coleraine.<br/><br/>
						<b>Costs</b><br/>
						Train travel is more expensive than bus travel and one-way fares are particularly
						poor value : a midweek return ticket is often about the same as a one-way fare.
						First-class tickets cost around 5euro to 10euro more than the standard fare for a single journey.
						</p>

					<div id='tab3' style='display: none;'>
						<p>
						Ireland’s new-found affluence means there are far more cars on the road,
						and the building of new roads and the upgrading of existing ones just cannot keep pace.
						Be prepared for delays, especially at holiday weekends. <b>AA Roadwatch</b>
						(1550 131 811; <a href="http://www.aaroadwatch.ie" onclick="OpenPopup(this.href); return false">
						www.aaroadwatch.ie</a>) provides traffic information in the Republic.<br/>
						In the Republic, speed-limit and distance signs are in kilometres;
						in the North, speed-limit and distance signs are in miles.<br/>
						You’ll need a good road map and sense of humour to deal with the severe lack of
						signposts in the Republic, and on minor roads be prepared for lots of potholes.<br/>
						Petrol is considerably cheaper in the Republic than in the North.<br/>
						Most service stations accept payment by credit card, but some small, remote ones may take cash only.
						All cars on public roads must be insured. If you are bringing your own vehicle in to the country,
						check that your insurance will cover you in Ireland.<br/><br/>

						<b>Hire</b><br/>

						Car hire in Ireland is expensive, so you’re often better off making arrangements in your
						home country with some sort of package deal. In July and August it’s wise to book well ahead.
						Most cars are manual; automatic cars are available but they’re more expensive to hire.
						The international hire companies and the major local operators have offices all over Ireland.
						Nova Car Hire (<a href="http://www.rentacar-ireland.com" onclick="OpenPopup(this.href); return false">
						www.rentacar-ireland.com</a>) acts as an agent for Alamo, Budget, European
						and National, and offers greatly discounted rates. In the Republic typical weekly
						high-season hire rates with Nova are around €150 for a small car, €185 for a medium-sized car,
						and €320 for a five-seater people carrier. In the North, similar cars are marginally more ­expensive.
						When hiring a car be sure to check if the price includes collision-damage waiver
						(CDW), insurance (eg for car theft and windscreen damage), value-added tax (VAT)
						and unlimited mileage.<br/>
						If you’re travelling from the Republic into Northern Ireland it’s important to be
						sure that your insurance covers journeys to the North. People aged under 21 aren’t
						allowed to hire a car; for the majority of hire companies you have to be aged at
						least 23 and have had a valid driving licence for a minimum of one year.
						Some companies in the Republic won’t rent to you if you’re aged 74 or over;
						there’s no upper age limit in the North.

						<b>Airlines in Ireland</b><br/>
						Ireland’s size makes domestic flying unnecessary unless you’re in a hurry,
						but there are flights between Dublin and Belfast, Cork, Derry, Donegal, Galway, Kerry,
						Shannon and Sligo, as well as a Belfast-Cork service. Most flights within Ireland
						take around 30 to 50 minutes.<br/><br/>

						The only domestic carriers are:<br/>
						<b>Aer Árann</b> (1890-462 726, in Dublin 01-814 5240, in Galway 091-593 034,
